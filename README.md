# KetoMeals

This is a simple CRUD REST API using .NET6. 

I followed along a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

The idea is to be able to save Keto meal ideas.
An example of a Keto Meal:

{
  "name": "Keto Egg Noodles",
  "description": "This keto pasta noodles recipe has just 2.7g net carbs and 3 ingredients!",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups Mozzarella Cheese",
    "4 large Egg Yolks",
    "1/2cup Lupin Flour"
  ],
  "calories": 248.7,
  "net_carbs": 2.7
}
